"""Availability probes for the heavy dependencies core.symbolic uses.

Every primitive in this package that needs angr / claripy
should call the relevant ``*_available()`` at entry and return a
descriptive :class:`SymbolicResult` when the dep is missing, rather
than raising ImportError. Callers (the LLM tool wrappers) can then
present a clean "capability unavailable" signal instead of a
Python traceback.

Each probe attempts the import in a DISPOSABLE CHILD process, never
in-process: angr's import chain reaches pypcode_native's C++ init,
which can abort the host uncatchably (SIGABRT) in state-heavy
processes — Python cannot catch a signal raised inside a C
extension's init, so an in-process probe puts the whole run (or an
xdist worker set) on the line. The child's fate maps to the bool:
clean exit means available; nonzero exit, death by signal, or
timeout means unavailable.

Cheap by design — one child per probe name, cached per process.
Probe failures are logged once at debug level; subsequent calls
return the cached bool without re-attempting.
