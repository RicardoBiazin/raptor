"""PHP gadget-chain oracle — mechanical CWE-502 witness, both directions.

Enumerates PHP magic methods across a target tree via tree-sitter-php
and traces property flows from unserialize-reachable object state into
sinks (file ops, command execution, include, SQL, output). Both
directions of the gadget question become tool-grounded:

* **Found chain** — a witness exhibit (class, magic method, property
  path, sink line). WITNESS-GRADE, detection-role: it boosts and
  exhibits, it never confirms a finding alone (every stamp this
  channel mints is detection-grade by :func:`is_detection_rule_id` —
  the sanwit precedent). A gadget chain adjudicates gadget EXISTENCE,
  not the taint path from request data to the unserialize call.
* **Verified absence** — a refutation INPUT, not a refutation. In this
  increment absence renders as strong hint-tier evidence with a
  completeness census attached ("no gadget chains found in the N/M
  parseable PHP files; depth limits stated"). Absence-as-suppression
  follows the binary oracle's earned-suppression precedent: NO
  consumer hard-suppresses on this artifact until a measured corpus
  earns the promotion (a named follow-up — see the module constants
  ``ABSENCE_*`` and the channel's outcome mapping, which never emits
  ``refuted``).

Approximations — stated, never implied away:

* **Flow depth**: intra-method direct flows (property reads,
  straight-line local assignments, concatenation/interpolation, a
  small seed set of string-propagating builtins) plus exactly ONE
  level of same-class method-call indirection. No inheritance-resolved
  dispatch, no cross-class hops, no loop/branch sensitivity. A gadget
  needing a deeper chain is NOT found — which is why absence is
  census-qualified evidence, not proof.
* **Class availability**: PHP gadget classes must be loaded or
  autoloadable at the unserialize site. Statically knowable bases are
  recorded per chain (``same_file`` / ``autoload_registered`` /
  ``included_somewhere`` via a provided include-graph / the honest
  ``not_established``); none of them proves runtime availability.
* **Trigger conditions**: ``__destruct``/``__wakeup``/
  ``__unserialize`` fire from unserialize itself; ``__toString`` /
  ``__call`` / ``__get`` / ``__set`` chains carry an explicit
  ``trigger_requires`` describing the extra usage context they need.
* **Encoding**: name identity is judged over the at-rest bytes with
  ASCII-only casefolding (PHP's rule). A source stored in UTF-16 is
  outside the model: its ``<?php`` open tag is equally invisible to
  this parser and to a stock Zend lexer, but a deployment that
  TRANSCODES files at include time could execute code the census
  never parsed. Recorded gap, not modelled.

The oracle is pure static analysis — no LLM calls, no execution of
target code. Grammar absence is a recorded capability gap (the
channel returns ``skipped``, the artifact stamps
``capability.tree_sitter_php: false``), NEVER a silent pass.

    when its casefolded, namespace-normalised form is a census family
    name (:data:`_CENSUS_CALL_NAMES`), block the promotable tier as
    a ``family-literal-mention`` registration.

    Why it exists: the literal-target dispatch in
    :func:`_census_global_call` resolves only
    ``call_user_func``/``call_user_func_array`` — but PHP has an
    open-ended set of callable-forwarding builtins (``array_map``,
    ``array_walk``, ``array_filter``, ``register_shutdown_function``,
    ``iterator_apply``, ...) and user code adds its own forwarders,
    and a callable string reaches a forwarder from ANY storage
    position: an argument, a variable assigned two lines up, a
    default parameter value, a returned literal, a constant or
    property initializer, an attribute argument, an array element.
    Enumerating either the forwarders or the carrying positions is
    an allowlist that rots the moment a new shape ships; instead the
    family name itself, statically spelled anywhere in the tree, is
    treated as a possible registration. The deliberate fail-closed
    trade: a benign tree that carries a bare family-name string as
    ordinary data (say, logging the word ``assert``) loses the
    promotable tier — over-block, the safe error for a suppression
    blocker. Multi-segment literals (``'App\\unserialize'``,
    ``'Cls::method'``) name a DIFFERENT symbol and never block — the
    match is whole-value against the global family names only.

    ``consumed`` carries the byte spans of literals the precise
    dispatch already resolved, so
    ``call_user_func('spl_autoload_register', $cb)`` keeps its
    single precise census entry instead of gaining a duplicate.

    Known residual (documented, not caught): a family name whose
    fragments are carried to the assembly point OUTSIDE one
    expression — ANY shape where the name never appears whole in
    one literal or one pure-literal concat expression. The defining
    clause is the boundary; illustrative shapes include builtin
    assembly (``sprintf``, ``str_replace``, ``implode``/``join``,
    ``strtr``, ``strrev``, ``str_repeat``), interpolation with
    variables, and cross-statement fragment assembly — ``.=``
    append of literal fragments and ``.``-concat of
    literal-initialized variables, constants, or class constants
    (statically resolvable in principle, but only by
    assignment/constant flow tracking, a new engine with its own
    false-absence surface — the census claims single-expression
    static visibility only). Such a value reaches a forwarder only
    as a dynamic value; where it instead reaches a dynamic CALLEE,
    the dynamic-callee fact catches that shape independently.

      alone).

      the strong-absence variant, with a degraded census the weak
      one (``no_chains_found`` — surface exists or an autoload
