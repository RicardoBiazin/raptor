"""Bounded-concurrency executor for /audit review tasks.

Drives ``review_one_function()`` through a ``TaskGraph``, running up to
``max_workers`` reviews concurrently.  Taint summaries are published
after each completion, unlocking dependent tasks automatically.

When ``max_workers=1`` the execution is serial and deterministic — the
same order as the current loop.  Higher values enable LLM-call overlap
at the cost of non-deterministic observation ordering.

# 20) silently commits the cheap glance guess as the FINAL verdict for
# ≥99.8% of glance-suspicious functions on a kernel-scale checklist
# (~125k functions) — a silent depth downgrade on a verdict-carrying
# path; HIGHER buys full reviews with real money on a signal the
# glance tier exists to keep cheap, and the checklist size that drives
# the derivation is TARGET-derived — a hostile tree inflating its
# function count must not be able to buy unbounded escalation spend,
