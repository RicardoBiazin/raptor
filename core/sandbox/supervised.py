"""Supervised process trees — reliable teardown plumbing, NOT a sandbox.

``spawn_supervised()`` launches a long-running helper (an analysis
server, a JVM, a tool daemon) as a *supervised tree*: every descendant
the target creates lives inside one teardown domain, and a single
verified stop call — or the death of the owning RAPTOR process — ends
all of it, with the kernel (not a pid scan) as the proof.

**This module provides NO security confinement.** No Landlock, no
seccomp, no mount or filesystem isolation, no network policy — a
supervised target runs with the caller's full ambient authority. It is
process-lifetime containment only. Anything untrusted belongs under
the sandbox profiles (``core.sandbox.run`` / ``run_untrusted``), never
here; that is also why nothing in this module carries a ``run_``
name and why the supervised tiers appear in none of the sandbox
profile or containment-floor tables.

Process topology (pidns tier)::

    caller ──fork── A (supervisor, this module's code)
                    │   os.unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWPID[|CLONE_NEWNET])
                    │   — ONE call, never staged —
                    ├──fork── B (ns-init waiter, PID 1 of the new pid-ns)
                    │         └──fork── C (target, PID 2) ── execvpe
                    └── poll-multiplexed supervision of B

- A performs the single ``unshare`` call (a staged second call is
  refused on restricted-userns hosts — the pid-ns must ride the same
  syscall as the userns grant), writes the deny-setgroups + identity
  uid/gid maps, and reports readiness (achieved tier, B's pid, C's
  pid) plus an SCM_RIGHTS-transferred pidfd on B over a status
  socketpair before settling into supervision.
- B arms ``PR_SET_PDEATHSIG(SIGKILL)`` keyed to A, then closes the
  post-fork race with a poll(timeout=0) POLLHUP probe on a liveness
  pipe whose SOLE write end lives in A (``getppid()`` is useless to a
  pid-ns init — its parent reads as 0 — and is used NOWHERE in this
  module). If the prctl itself fails, B ``_exit``s with a distinct
  code and the boot fails closed. B forwards SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP/
  SIGQUIT to C, reaps every orphan that reparents to it, and mirrors
  C's fate (exit status, or 128+signum for a signal death).
- C reports its outside-the-namespace pid, wires stdio, and execs.

Exit-path invariant (pinned by test): **on its own code paths A exits
only because B exited (mirroring B's status) or because the death pipe
reported the caller gone (collapse the tree, then exit).** A forwards
SIGTERM and SIGINT to B and keeps supervising; any other fatal signal
(SIGHUP/SIGQUIT included — only B forwards those onward to C) kills A
with its default disposition, and the tree then collapses via B's
PDEATHSIG rather than by supervision — a collapse, never abandonment
of a live B. Even the last-ditch internal-error path SIGKILLs B and
awaits it before exiting.

Session posture (kill mode vs survive mode): in ``survive`` mode A
calls ``setsid()`` immediately post-fork so session-scoped teardown of
the caller cannot reap a tree the caller asked to outlive it. In
``kill`` mode A DELIBERATELY stays in the caller's session and process
group — group-directed teardown aimed at the caller is allowed to take
the supervisor with it, and the PDEATHSIG chain plus namespace
collapse then take the tree.

Degraded (group) tier: hosts that refuse unprivileged user namespaces
degrade — loudly (a logged warning names the refusal and the weaker
teardown scope) but never a crash — to a plain
``subprocess.Popen(..., start_new_session=True)`` with the shared
``set_pdeathsig`` preexec in kill mode. That is exactly the
pre-existing posture of RAPTOR's tool spawns: nothing a caller has
today gets worse, and ``pid_ns="require"`` turns the degrade into a
refusal instead.

Kill-path safety: every handle-side signal to the tree goes through
``signal.pidfd_send_signal`` on the SCM_RIGHTS-received pidfd for B
(pid-reuse safe); ``ns_init_pid`` / ``target_pid`` are diagnostic
metadata and are never signalled by number. No kill path in this
module can address a pid or pgid <= 1 or the caller's own process
group. On the pidns tier the death proof is ``waitpid`` completion on
A (whose own exit paths are gated on reaping B, whose exit the kernel
gates on the namespace being empty) — there is no /proc scanning
anywhere. That gate exists only on A's OWN exit paths: an exit of A
recorded without it (A killed from outside) is not yet a proof, and
the handle then demands the kernel's direct witness — B's pidfd
turning readable — before reporting a verified teardown.

    scan-window race, it does not close it: a hidepid-class option
    flipped on the shared proc SUPERBLOCK from a sibling mount
    namespace never bumps this namespace's event counter, so a
    flip-and-revert through that channel stays invisible mid-scan
    (bounded to other-uid members — hidepid hides only those; a
    PERSISTING flip is still declared by the ordinary reads), and a
    coherently forged /proc mounted before the scan opened was never
    detectable by reads through it — the pidns tier's pidfd witness
    is the answer to that attacker. The per-member death proof
    (``_member_provably_dead``'s /proc/<pid>/task reads) is taken
    INSIDE this window — after the membership walk, before the
    post-scan declaration re-read and the verdict poll — and travels
    on the returned members, so the death corroborations consume it
    without re-reading /proc after the latch fd closed. On kernels
    whose mounts file lacks the poll hook the verdict poll never
    fires and the scan degrades to exactly the two-read behaviour
    (a persisting mask over a member is still declared by the
    post-scan re-read; only attach-and-detach inside the window
    stays invisible there)."""

        stragglers. pgid was captured pre-kill and passed the refusal
        predicate.

        The group counts dead ONLY on positive evidence:

        (a) ``killpg(pgid, 0)`` raises ESRCH — the kernel's own "no
            such group" (it counts zombies as members, so this also
            covers a promptly-reaping init); or
        (b) the /proc scan's view is UNOCCLUDED (no mount-declared pid
            filtering, no unreadable entry, own pid listed), it SIGHTED
            at least one member with matching pgrp, every sighted
            member reads state Z, and each sighted member's
            /proc/<pid>/task holds only Z tasks (state Z at the process
            level alone is NOT death: a zombie thread-group leader can
            front a live worker thread; a Z-through-tasks member is
            dead, merely awaiting a reap that is not ours to perform
            under a non-reaping init).

        Everything else refuses at the deadline. An unlistable /proc is
        no proof; an OCCLUDED view proves only what it sighted, never
        absence — a hidden live member cannot be ruled out. Zero
        sighted members while killpg-0 still SUCCEEDS is a positive
        CONTRADICTION — a skewed procfs pid view (this /proc does not
        show the pid namespace the signals travel in), so keep
        escalating and refuse loudly, never claim death. This seam owns
        a group it has already signalled, so escalation continues
        throughout; only the VERIFY claim needs the trustworthy view.

        Evidence scope: every /proc read this verify consumes — the
        membership walk, the per-member /proc/<pid>/task death proofs,
        and both mount-declaration reads — happens inside ONE scan's
        latched window, before that scan's churn-verdict poll; the
        proofs travel on the returned members (``provably_dead``) and
        nothing here re-reads /proc after the scan returned. A mount
        attached after the scan can therefore only affect the NEXT
        scan, whose own latch and declaration reads cover it. On
        kernels without the mounts poll hook the window degrades to
        the two-declaration-read posture — a persisting mask is still
        declared, only attach-and-detach inside the window stays
        invisible there."""

    This is NOT a sandbox: no security confinement of any kind is
    applied to the target. For untrusted code use the sandbox
    profiles; this primitive only guarantees teardown.

    - ``cmd``: argv list only — no shell-string form exists.
    - ``on_parent_death`` (REQUIRED, no default — the caller must own
      this fate decision explicitly): ``"kill"`` = the owning process's
      death, however it dies, collapses the tree (death pipe on the
      pidns tier; PDEATHSIG on the group-tier leader). ``"survive"`` =
      the tree outlives the caller (the supervisor detaches into its
      own session).
    - ``env=None`` snapshots ``RaptorConfig.get_safe_env()`` at spawn
      time; a caller-provided mapping is used VERBATIM.
    - ``stdout``/``stderr``: fd, open file object, or
      ``subprocess.DEVNULL``; None inherits. PIPE/STDOUT are rejected.
    - ``pid_ns``: ``"auto"`` (probe; degrade to the group tier on
      refusal), ``"require"`` (SandboxSetupError instead of degrading),
      ``"off"`` (group tier unconditionally).
    - ``net_ns=True`` adds a private network namespace to the SAME
      unshare call (loopback brought up). It exists only on the pidns
      tier: combinations that would silently drop it (``pid_ns="off"``,
      or a refused/failed namespace under ``"auto"``) raise
      SandboxSetupError instead — requested isolation is never
      silently downgraded.
    - ``name``: diagnostic label for errors and repr.

    Runtime-refusal discipline: if the probe said the pidns tier
    engages but the live spawn's unshare is refused anyway, the cached
    probe verdict is flipped to refused (so later ``"auto"`` spawns
    skip the doomed attempt) and this call degrades to the group tier
    (``"auto"``) or raises (``"require"``).
